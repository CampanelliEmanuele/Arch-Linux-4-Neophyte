File management:
    CREATE FILE:
        1. touch newFileName.extension
        2. echo "FileText" > newFIleName.extension
    EDIT FILE:
        1. nano fileName.extension
        2. vim fileName.extension # VIM required
    RENAME FILE:
        mv fileName newFileName
    SHOW FILE'S TEXT:
        cat fileName.extension
    SHOW HIDDEN FILES&FOLDERS:
        ls -a
    SHOW CURRENT DIRECTORY:
        pwd
    MOVE FILE IN A FOLDER:
        mv fileName directoryName
    MOVE FILE INTO THE PARENT FOLDER:
        mv fileName ..
    DELETE A:
        FILE:
            rm fileName
        DIRECTORY:
            rm -d fileName.extension    # Can remove only empty directories
            rm -r directoryName         # Can remove also not empty directory
    SHOW USED RESOURCES:
        top
    RUN THE LAST command
        !*...*
        Example:
            gcc -o oggetto file.c   # command 1
            ls -a
            !gc                     # "gc" is in "gcc", so (in this case) "!gc" is equal to "gcc .."
