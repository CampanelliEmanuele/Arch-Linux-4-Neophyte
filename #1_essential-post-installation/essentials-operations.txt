Run these commands:
  sudo pacman -Sy
  sudo pacman -S base-devel

  sudo pacman -Syyu     (update system)
  # sudo pacman -S xorg   (Install a display server) - Probably not necessary

Git installation:
  cd
  sudo pacman -S git

After that, run:
  cd
  clear
  sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager --now

  chmod +x auto-install.sh
  ./auto-install.sh
